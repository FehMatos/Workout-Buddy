<p>The project's idea came from the youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja">Net Ninja</a>, he created a whole playlist - two, actually lol - developing the app from scratch, first the front-end, then back-end, then the auth system. I took it as a challenge, this was my first fullstack application. I had to consult the videos here and there, but I ended up successfully building it, and it felt pretty good at the end. </p>

<p>The authentication system was made using <b>JSON Web Token (JWT)</b> and <b>local storage</b> to store the sessions. Now, on a real production app, we would definitely use cookies instead of local storage, mainly for security reasons. On this example app, I used local storage for simplicity's sake. </p>
